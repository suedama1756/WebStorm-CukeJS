WebStorm-CukeJS
===============

CucumberJS Plugin for WebStorm

This plugin offers several enhancements over the one shipped with WebStorm 8.03.

* Support for debugging.
* Paths are saved relative to the $PROJECT_DIR$ allowing the configurations to be "shared" and checked in.
* Tag expressions ('@' is optional)
